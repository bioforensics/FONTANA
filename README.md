## This beginning step is for Daniele's Group only:
## Beginning - Prior to running FONTANA
Please see [Colonial One's help page](https://colonialone.gwu.edu/getting-access/). For working through the terminal, please complete the [Codecademy's Command Line Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). For help related to GW's HPC (Colonial One), please see [our help page](https://gwcbi.github.io/HPC/).

### Beginning on Colonial One
See Colonial One's [wiki page](https://colonialone.gwu.edu/available-filesystems/). You will run *all* FONTANA related stuff on `lustre` (**NOT** your home directory). You can access `lustre` by such: `cd /lustre/podinigrp`.

You will then want to create a directory for each person individually. Do so by doing `mkdir -p $name`, so for example I would do `mkdir -p kgibson` and now I would have a directory named kgibson in this directory.
